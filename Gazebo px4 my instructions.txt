#####** This is a simple guide on how to insert a whole new model on gazebo sitl px4 framework **#####

## 1 Regarding the model on gazebo
The models on gazebo sitl are in 
    Firmware/Tools/sitl_gazebo/models

*On this folder each model has its own folder with at least two files on it. They probably must follow the 
naming schematic as bellow:
    - my_model/
            - model.config
            - my_model.sdf

*The content of model.config file should follow the bellow:
"
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<model>
  <name>my_model</name>
  <version>1.0</version>
  <sdf version='1.4'>my_model.sdf</sdf>

  <author>
   <name>author_name</name>
   <email>asdfas@asdas</email>
  </author>

  <description>
    Model description
  </description>
</model>
"

*The content of the .sdf model can be very large, but bellow is what it should contain in terms of naming:
"
<sdf version='1.5'>

  <model name='my_model'>

  ...
  ...

  **There is also probably requirements concening the name of other objects inside the model, i.e., names of joints and links.
    Those names may be more relevant when they are passed down to the structures on the *mavlink plugin*, that  makes the connection
    between the .sdf model and the "inner model" on px4.

    MUST add this once I figure it out**

## 2 Regarding what to do to make your model to show up as a target for the sitl_gazebo build system.
The command to build and run the simulation on sitl_gazebo with a specific model follow the patter bellow:

    $ make px4_sitl gazebo_my_model

Where you replace 'my_model' with the name you declare on the model files on the privious step.

*To make this work with your model as well, you must add your model name as a build target on the file:
    /Firmware/platforms/posix/cmake/sitl_target.cmake

  - The place where you add your model name starts on line 51 of the file .cmake:
  "
  ...
  ...
  # create targets for each viewer/model/debugger combination
51  set(viewers none jmavsim gazebo)
52  set(debuggers none ide gdb lldb ddd valgrind callgrind)
53  set(models none shell
54	  if750a iris iris_opt_flow iris_vision iris_rplidar iris_irlock iris_obs_avoid iris_rtps solo typhoon_h480
55	  plane
56	  standard_vtol tailsitter tiltrotor
57	  hippocampus rover my_model)
   ...
   ...
  "
